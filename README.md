## Cat_lives_counter

Life counter for cat lives (default 9)

A simple python scrip that decreases the life total (tracked in a txt file) or resets it back to 9 (because of cat) depending on which args the python file is run with.
Args are "dec" to decrease or "reset" to set it back to 9. You can also run the 2 vbs files to modify the life total headless. I did this initially with bat, but it caused flickering as bat is not running headles.

Hook up the .txt file with a GDI text source in OBS to have a life countdown going
